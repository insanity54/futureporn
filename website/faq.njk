            </div>

            <p>It's due to the public IPFS gateway (https://dweb.link) being overloaded by requests of popular content. The IPFS gateway is a courtesy service and there are a lot of people visiting Futureporn and using that free IPFS gateway to download VODs. After so much traffic, the gateway starts dropping requests.</p>

            <p>Futureporn is not using the public IPFS gateway as it's developers intend. The intention of the public gateway is short-term developer testing. In the early days, files listed on Futureporn were served because the traffic was small. Futureporn has grown and now the public gateway is cutting us off.</p>

            <p>The intended method for serving lots of files is for every participant in IPFS to run their own gateway. For a time, I ran an IPFS gateway for Futureporn, but quickly discovered that it would cost $100+ every month to operate. My budget for Futureporn is $8/month which ended the gateway. For now, it's just going to be spotty as Futureporn uses the public IPFS gateway.</p>

            <p>There's a workaround which is to use a different gateway. example: <pre>https://ipfs.io/ipfs/[INSERT_CONTENT_ID_HERE]</pre> instead of <pre>https://dweb.link/ipfs/[INSERT_CONTENT_ID_HERE]</pre></p>

            <p>Technically savvy? Even better is to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/">run your own IPFS node <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a>.</p>

          <p>Yes! Please and thank you! All VOD contributors get their name listed on the site.</p>

          <p>Adding new lubers is not planned at this time. I would love to, but adding more is going to take extra work, storage, and upkeep. I would need a budget to work with. I have a tier on my <a target="_blank" href="https://patreon.com/CJ_Clippy/">Patreon<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a> for this.</p>
