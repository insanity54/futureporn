            <p>It's not just you. Futureporn is running on free services and those services throttle traffic. Workarounds include downloading the VOD in advance or running your own IPFS gateway.</p>

            <p>Every participant in IPFS is encouraged to run their own gateway. The budget for Futureporn is too low to afford paying the bandwidth cost to do so. For now, it's just going to be spotty as Futureporn uses the public IPFS gateway.</p>

            <p>There's a workaround which is to use a different gateway. example: <pre>https://ipfs.io/ipfs/[INSERT_CONTENT_ID_HERE]</pre> instead of <pre>https://dweb.link/ipfs/[INSERT_CONTENT_ID_HERE]</pre></p>

            <p>Technically savvy? Even better is to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/">run your own IPFS node <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a>.</p>

          <p>Adding new <a href="https://twitter.com/FalseEyeD/status/1530172468584861697" target="_blank">lubers<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a> is not planned at this time. I would love to, but adding more is going to take extra work, storage, and upkeep. I would need a budget to work with. I have a tier on my <a target="_blank" href="https://patreon.com/CJ_Clippy/">Patreon<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></a> for this.</p>
