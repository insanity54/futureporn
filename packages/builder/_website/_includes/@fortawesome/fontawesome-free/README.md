These icons are copied from @fortawesome/fontawesome-free@6.3.0

I copied these files because there is an issue with how @fortawesome/fontawesome-free exports itself.

https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/18514 

Issue #18514 is closed, but the error persists in my setup.

The issue presents itself as warnings in the console. By copying the fontawesome files to the includes directory, I'm avoiding those console warnings.

If the issue is resolve in the future, it would be good to remove these files and directly import fontawesome.
